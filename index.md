# About me

I graduated couple of years ago from Aalto University with the master’s degree in technology and currently I am working as an IT-consultant doing mostly testing. However, a pure software engineering is not my ideal job and next January I will start at a new position as a data scientist. This course will be part of my bachelor’s degree in Aalto School of Business, which I am pursuing along work.

I am a curious person and I see it important to be well-aware of hot trends in the IT-industry (which DevOps definitely is), although my current interests lie mostly in the field of data science and artificial intelligence. Perhaps at the moment I have no intensions to dive further into DevOps, but it is good to know the concept and how it can be possibly utilized in my work.
