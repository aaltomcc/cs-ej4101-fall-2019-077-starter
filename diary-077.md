# Why this course?

Honestly speaking, the main reason for taking the course was that 1 credit fitted well into my study plan and there was no need to attend any kind of sessions. I could take some more advanced course on the topic since I already had some knowledge of the issue mostly from my work experience. I cannot say that I have worked a lot and directly with DevOps, but e.g. I have some experience of managing continuous integration server and writing test automation cases (which however were not integrated into continuous integration pipeline, I run them on a local machine only). I have also attended introduction session about DevOps organized by my current employer.

With that stated, I must admit that I had no expectations for learning outcomes and was just hoping to pass the course. Perhaps I am not so interested in technical side of DevOps, instead more fascinating topic in my eyes is how to efficiently implement DevOps inside an organization and what obstacles may be on this way. Or even more radically – is DevOps always good (especially for small/medium-size organizations), may it have some disadvantages too? E.g. in the project I am currently working most of testing is done manually - many backend implementations cannot be tested directly from UI and unit tests are not even supposed to cover comprehensively software’s functionality, on the other hand amount of constant changes in a frontend code would require significantly more people to implement comprehensive automate testing. Moving to mostly/fully automated testing would require very radical changes in the whole software development process starting from requirements specification stage, and how much benefits (cost savings) it will bring after all to the project? 

# What I have learned?

As I had a software engineering experience I started first to work with the advanced project. I managed to deploy a single page site with a picture but then got stuck with adding second page and link to it (perhaps I was trying to do it in a too fancy way). As deadline was approaching and I never had any interest to learn web development, I decided to switch to the starter project. Nevertheless, from that I learned new: I was already quite familiar with git but didn’t know that it is possible to host webpages on GitHub - this was quite useful information and I may use it for some occasions in the future. I was unaware about Travis CI, but as mentioned above I already had some experience with CI servers which however occurred quite a long ago, so this part wasn’t totally new yet required some googling and trying before it worked. I also learned basics of Markdown and Hugo, but as I am not interested at all in web development, I don’t think I will use or deepen this knowledge a much in the future. 

From videos I learned most about configuration management and software containers – I had not even heard about the former and the concept of latter seemed unclear for me. I learned also about Vagrant, Serverspec, Saltsack and Graphite. I was already familiar with quite all covered non-technical issues like culture, agile and learning organization. Overall, I think that course is well designed as it provides good introduction to DevOps and is suitable for students with different background.
